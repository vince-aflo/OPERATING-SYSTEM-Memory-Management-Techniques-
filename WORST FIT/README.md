#### WORST FIT MEMORY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE
In this memory technique, the process traverses the whole memory and always search for the largest hole/partition, and then the process is placed in that hole/partition.

## HOW IT WORKS
This program accept the following as inputs

	- Number of Blocks
	- Number of Files
	- Size of every Block
	- Size of every Files
	
### *After accepting the input it then compute the following*

	- Fragmentation
	Which is Block size - file size

	- Allocation
	Which is assigning the file to largest-fitting available block size

### *After the computation, the program then display the following*

	- Block numbers
	- Block sizes
	- Files sizes -File numbers
	- Fragmentation for every block


### RUN CODE
	To run the this program. You should copy the entire contents of the folder into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
