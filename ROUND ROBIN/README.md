#	ROUND ROBIN CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice

####	HOW IT WORKS
This program accept the following as inputs

*	Number of Processes
*	Size of time slice
*	Burst Time for every process


##	After accepting the input it then compute the following

#### - Sorting

	Which is arranging the processes starting from which execute first using time slice

#### - Waiting Time

	Which is Previous waiting time + Previous burst time

#### - Turnaround Time

	Which is Previous turnaround time + Burst time

#### - Average Waiting time

	Which is total of waiting time / number of processes

#### - Average Turnaround Time

	Which is total of burst time / number of processes

### After the computation, the program then display the following

* Average Burst Time
* Average Turnaround Time
* Process Number(In order of execution)
* Every Process's Burst Time
* Every Process's Waiting Time
* Every Process's Turnaround Time



### RUN CODE
To run the this program. You should copy the entire contents of the folder into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
