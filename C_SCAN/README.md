# C_SCAN DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
___
Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling algorithm is a modified version of SCAN disk scheduling algorithm that deals with the inefficiency of SCAN algorithm by servicing the requests more uniformly. 


### HOW IT WORKS

This program has the following variables with values assigned to them
####  seek_num
####  distance
####  current_track
####  size
####  disk_size




###  CALCULATIONS
#### *  direction- left and right 
#### *   sorting
#### *  absolute distance
#### * 	total count
#### *	distance




#### DISPLAY
* Initial position of head
* Total number of seek operations
* seek sequence



### RUN CODE
To run the this program. You should copy the entire content of the folder into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
