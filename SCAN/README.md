### HOW IT WORKS

This program has the following variables with values assigned to them
 * total_seek
 * distance
 * currentT
 * size
 * disk_size




###  CALCULATIONS
####  direction- left and right 
####   sorting
####   absolute distance
####	total count





#### DISPLAY

* Total number of seek operations
* seek sequence
