# SHORTEST JOB FIRST CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution.


### *This program accept the following as inputs*

* Number of processes
* Burst Time for every process

*After accepting the input it then compute the following* 

#### * Sorting
		 Which is `arranging the processes starting from the one with smallest execution time`
	
####  * Waiting Time

		Which is Previous waiting time + Previous burst time

#### * Turnaround Time

		Which is Previous turnaround time + Burst time

####  * Average Waiting time

		Which is total of waiting time / number of processes

####  * Average Turnaround Time

		Which is total of burst time / number of processes


#### After the computation, the program then display the following

* Process Number(In order of execution)
* Every Process Burst Time
* Every Process Waiting Time
* Every Process Turnaround Time
* Average Burst Time
* Average Turnaround Time


####	RUN CODE
To run the this program. You should copy the entire contents of the folder into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
