# PRIORITY CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
Priority CPU scheduling is one of the most common scheduling algorithms. Each process is assigned a priority. Process with the highest priority is to be executed first and so on. Processes with the same priority are executed on first come first served basis.

### HOW IT WORKS
This program accept the following as inputs

- Number of Processes
- Burst Time & Priority for every Process

### After accepting the input it then compute the following

#### - Execution Order
	Which is executing the processes from the one having the highest priority

#### - Waiting Time

	Which is Previous waiting time + Previous burst time

#### - Turnaround Time

	Which is Previous turnaround time + Burst time

#### - Average Waiting time

	Which is total of waiting time / number of processes

#### - Average Turnaround Time

	Which is total of burst time / number of processes

### After the computation, the program then display the following

*	Process Number(In order of execution)
*	Every Process Burst Time
*	Every Process Waiting Time
*	Every Process Turnaround Time
*	Average Burst Time
*	Average Turnaround Time


### RUN CODE
To run the this program. You should copy the entire contents of the folder into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
