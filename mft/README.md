# MULTIPROGRAMMING WITH A FIXED NUMBER OF TASKS
___

MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks) is one of the old memory management techniques in which the memory is partitioned into fixed size partitions and each job is assigned to a partition. The memory assigned to a partition does not change.

### HOW IT WORKS
This program accept the following as inputs

* Total Memory available
* Block Size
* Number of Processes
* Memory Require for every Process


### After accepting the input it then compute the following

#### * Number of Blocks
	Which is Total Memory Available / Block Size

#### * External Fragmentation
	Which is Total Memory available - Number of blocks * Block Size

#### * Internal Fragmentation
	Which is Block Size - Memory require for a particular Process

#### After the computation, the program then display the following

* Total Internal Fragmentation
* Total External Fragmentation
* Memory Require for Every Process
* Allocation


#### RUN CODE

To run the this program. You should copy the entire contents of the folder into a project in the IDE or Text Editor, and then run the Main.java in the folder.
